Hardware Architecture Description – Smart Waste Bin Network

The hardware architecture consists of the following components:

- Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the distance to waste surface.
- Microcontroller Unit (MCU): Processes sensor data.
- Communication Module: Sends data to the cloud server.
- Power Supply: Battery-based power source (solar optional).

All components are integrated inside a waste bin enclosure
to enable real-time waste monitoring.
