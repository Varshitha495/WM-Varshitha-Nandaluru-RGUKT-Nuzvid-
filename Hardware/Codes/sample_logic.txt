This file explains the conceptual hardware logic of the
Smart Waste Bin Network.

1. An ultrasonic sensor is placed inside the waste bin to
   measure the fill level.

2. The sensor data is read by a microcontroller
   (such as ESP32 or Arduino).

3. The microcontroller processes the sensor data and converts
   it into a percentage fill level.

4. The processed data is transmitted to the cloud server
   using a communication module (Wi-Fi/GSM/LoRa).

This is a logic-level explanation for a virtual IoT design.
