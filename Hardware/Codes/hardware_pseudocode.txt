START

Power ON microcontroller
Provide power to ultrasonic sensor
Configure input and output pins

LOOP
    Trigger ultrasonic sensor
    Measure echo time
    Calculate distance from echo time

    Send measured distance to microcontroller
    Microcontroller processes data

    IF distance indicates bin is nearly full
        Prepare data packet for transmission
    END IF
END LOOP
