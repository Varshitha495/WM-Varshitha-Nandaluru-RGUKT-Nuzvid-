Software Architecture Description – Smart Waste Bin Network

The software architecture follows a cloud-based IoT model.

Components:
- IoT Data Ingestion Layer: Receives data from smart bins.
- Database Layer: Stores bin fill-level data and timestamps.
- Processing Layer: Analyzes bin status and identifies overflow risks.
- Application Layer: Displays real-time data on a dashboard.

The architecture enables real-time monitoring, alert generation,
and decision support for optimized waste collection.
