This file describes the conceptual software logic of the
Smart Waste Bin Network system.

1. Each smart waste bin periodically sends its fill-level data
   to the cloud server using a wireless communication network.

2. The cloud server receives the data and stores it in a database
   along with bin ID, location, and timestamp.

3. The system continuously monitors the fill level of all bins.

4. If the fill level crosses a predefined threshold, an alert
   is generated for waste collection.

5. The processed data is displayed on a web-based dashboard
   for municipal authorities.

This is a virtual design representation and does not include
actual implementation code.
