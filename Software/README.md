## Code Validation Note

The provided firmware and cloud-side scripts represent logical reference implementations
developed for conceptual validation of the system design. Hardware-dependent operations
such as sensor timing, wireless communication, and network availability are abstracted
and validated using simulation environments (e.g., Wokwi) and unit-level testing.

Full end-to-end deployment requires physical hardware components, appropriate power
management, and live network configuration, which are outside the scope of this
virtual design challenge.
