# Smart Waste Bin Network – Virtual IoT Design

## Overview
This project presents a virtual IoT-based Smart Waste Bin Network designed to monitor waste fill levels in real time and optimize waste collection routes for smart city applications.

## Problem Statement
Traditional waste collection systems operate on fixed schedules, leading to inefficiencies such as overflowing bins and unnecessary fuel consumption.

## Proposed Solution
An IoT-enabled waste bin system that uses sensors, cloud connectivity, and real-time dashboards to improve waste management efficiency.

## System Components
### Hardware
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Microcontroller (ESP32/Arduino)
- Communication Module
- Power Supply

### Software
- Cloud Platform
- Database
- Web Dashboard

## Repository Structure
- Software: Contains software logic and architecture
- Hardware: Contains hardware logic and block diagrams

## Note
This is a virtual design project focused on system architecture and working logic.
